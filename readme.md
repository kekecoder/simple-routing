# Basic Routing Using PHP

This repo is for the tutorial i wrote on hashnode to teach about how to create simple routing logic in PHP without using any PHP framework.

### The following Route were implemented

- /about
- /contact

### The request method used in this project include

- POST -> To submit form
- GET -> To show different pages according to what the end user requested

NB: This is just basic, you can expand it and structure your code project file/folder well to avoid some securities issues.
